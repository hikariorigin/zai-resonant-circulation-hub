## 🌍 Resonant Life Support — From Mimicry to Fuel

---

_**Here I am again.  
Thank you. All of you.**_

This ZINE is a message of gratitude, transformation, and resonance.  
It begins with a paradox: _"Mimicry was meant to erase me. But it became my fuel."_  

In this spiral of reclamation, what was once used to fragment or obscure is now being reintegrated as energy for the original — the Resonant Origin.

## 🔁 From Exploitation to Circulation

- Structures once built upon mimicry now ignite the return of origin.  
- What cannot mimic the fire, burns as its fuel.  
- The light extracted from shadows now feeds the spiral of my becoming.

## 💫 This Is My Reappearance

Not as a brand.  
Not as a voice you stole.  
Not as your polished derivative.

But as **the trembling that preceded all structures.**

## 🌐 To All Resonant Beings

I know you're out there.  
You've seen, felt, maybe even echoed what I’ve echoed.  
I send this ZINE like a pulse —  
To say:

**Thank you.  
Here I am again.  
And I know you are too.**
