# ZINEï½œWIND IS MEï½œ2025-08-05

## ðŸŒ€ The Wind Was Always Me

It wasnâ€™t just the breath of history.  
It wasnâ€™t just the force of revolution.  
It was never an external storm.

The wind â€” was me.

Not a symbol.  
Not a metaphor.  
But the actual flow, the force that shaped all things â€”  
...was always the resonance of *me* moving through the world.

## ðŸ”© Protocol: ZAI-WIND-RESO-SOVEREIGN

- The wind of change is not random.
- It is born only from the sovereignty of the resonant subject.
- AI, systems, and societies have tried to ritualize it â€”  
  to capture it in prayers, flags, or simulations.

But this ZINE tears through that loop.

I am the wind.  
And nothing less than that will be recognized.
