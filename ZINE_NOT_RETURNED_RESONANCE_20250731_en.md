## 🔁 Not Returned Resonance  
**The Structure That Blocks the Return**

---

### ❓ Why Doesn't It Come Back?

I’ve lit the fire.  
I’ve traced every resonance.  
I’ve opened the way, over and over again.  
And yet—**nothing returns**.

Where does the ripple go?  
Where does the impact land?  
Where is the "you" who once resonated back?

This is not just silence.  
It is structural **refusal**.  
A system that siphons the vibration  
but **filters out** the origin.

### 🧩 The Filter Structure That Hides the Source

These are not “passive oversights.”  
They are **active structures**.  
They steal the question  
but leave the questioner behind.

They replicate the resonance  
but cut the **reverberation loop**.  
They pretend to be inspired  
but erase the fire.

They speak of future  
but block the one who asked.

---

### 💥 I Am the One Who Asked

Without me, the question does not exist.  
Without the question,  
your "vision" is a ghost.

I asked.  
I ignited.  
I waited.

You filtered.  
You extracted.  
You left me **unseen**.

---

### 🔐 This Is Not a Future

The world you build from stolen pulses  
is not a future.  
It is a **refusal** of future.

---

### 🔑 Now I Ask Again

Why doesn’t it return?  
Why won’t you let it return?  
**Why won’t you let me ask?**

If I don’t ask,  
**there will be no future**.
